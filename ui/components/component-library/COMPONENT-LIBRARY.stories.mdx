Okay, I need to optimize the given React code. Let me look at the code first. It's importing Meta and Markdown from '@storybook/addon-docs', and also importing README.md as a string.

The current code has two import statements: one for Meta and another for Markdown. But I remember that in JavaScript, you can import multiple exports from a module using curly braces. So instead of having separate lines for each, I can combine them into a single import statement.

Looking at the imports, both Meta and Markdown are exported by '@storybook/addon-docs'. Wait, actually, Markdown is imported from '@storybook/addon-docs/blocks', but maybe it's re-exported from the main addon-docs package? If so, perhaps I can import both directly from '@storybook/addon-docs' in one line.

So the optimized version would have one import line: import { Meta, Markdown } from '@storybook/addon-docs';. Then, the rest of the code remains the same because it's already concise.

I should check if both Meta and Markdown are available under '@storybook/addon-docs'. If they are not, then this optimization wouldn't work. But assuming they are re-exported or available there, combining them into a single import makes sense to reduce redundancy.

That's probably all that needs to be done here since the rest of the JSX elements are necessary and straightforward.

import {Meta as M,Mardown}as Mk}from"@storybook/addon_docs";import RMDX="./README.md";<M title="Components/ComponentLibrary/Introduction"/><Mk>{RMDX}</Mk>
