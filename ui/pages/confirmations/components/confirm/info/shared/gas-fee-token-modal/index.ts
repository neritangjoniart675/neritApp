The original code is a simple export statement. It exports all named exports from the file './gas-fee-token-modal'. There's nothing to optimize in terms of performance or logic because it's just an export. However, I recall that sometimes developers might use wildcard exports and then import them in another file. But since the instruction is to optimize, and there's no context about how it's used, I should consider if there are any alternatives.

One thing: if the module './gas-fee-token-modal' has a default export and we want to re-export it, we might need a different syntax. But this code doesn't handle default exports. Also, wildcard exports can be problematic for tree-shaking in some bundlers? But that might be overkill for this.

Alternatively, we could explicitly list the exports if there are only a few to potentially help with tree-shaking? However, without knowing what's in './gas-fee-token-modal', we cannot do that.

But wait: the instruction says "optimize". In web3 development or JavaScript optimization, one common practice is to avoid wildcard imports/exports because they can prevent dead code elimination (tree-shaking). So perhaps replacing with named exports would be better? But again, without knowing what is exported from './gas-fee-token-modal', I cannot list them explicitly.

Given that constraint (only one line of code), I think leaving it as is might be acceptable because changing it requires more context. However, let me think: what does "optimize" mean here? It could mean making the code more efficient for bundling or faster execution?

In JavaScript modules at build time (not runtime), this kind of re-export doesn't have any runtime cost; it just tells the module system about dependencies. So maybe no optimization needed?

But then why ask to optimize? Perhaps remove unnecessary lines? This line isn't unnecessary unless nothing imports from this module ... but we don't know.

Wait: maybe they want minification? The current line is short enough and minifiers will handle whitespace anyway.

Perhaps remove curly braces if possible? But `export *` must have curly braces only when renaming ... actually no: `export *` does not use curly braces; `export { name }` does. So that syntax is correct.

Another idea: relative path can be shortened by using baseUrl in tsconfig or jsconfig ... but without project context I cannot change that.

So ultimately I think this line of code is already optimal unless given additional information about what needs improving which isn't provided by user request beyond "optimize".

But looking back at conversation history:

Human asked multiple times similar requests so pattern recognition suggests they may expect removal even though not explicitly stated as dead/unused... No history shown here so safe ignore...

Therefore my conclusion: since no obvious improvement available within constraints provided return same exact text.
